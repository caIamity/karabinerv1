# Karabiner
First project in rust, creating a CLI  password generator for Linux and macOS. Feedback, ideas and criticism are welcome.

Make sure you have [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and pbcopy installed first.
Clone repo & use ```cargo build``` to compile and ```cargo run``` to start the program.

Goals for this project:
  1. Generate password & save to file in folder âœ…
  2. Copy to clipboard
  3. First startup with personal key
  4. Start building a password manager (optional : protected by password) 
  5. Make cool interface :)
  
Ignore Inarius, I just think he looks cool
